# Vehicle Price Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict the prices of vehicles using various features such as make, model, year, mileage, and more. The goal is to build a machine learning model that can accurately estimate the price of a vehicle based on its attributes.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains information about various vehicles, including:
- Make
- Model
- Year
- Mileage
- Engine Size
- Fuel Type
- Transmission
- Number of Doors
- Vehicle Type
- Price (target variable)

## Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:
- `vehicles.xls/`: Contains the dataset files.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and model development.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `models/`: Saved models and model evaluation results.
- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install the required libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
